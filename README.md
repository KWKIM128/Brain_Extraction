RGU-Net is a lightweight U-Net based model developed for automated brain extraction. The model implements the Ghost and Residual modules to produce 2D segmentation at a lower computational cost. 

This model was developed as part of my undergraduate dissertation and contains iterative model versions in the code folder. The rgunetv2.py script contains the source code for the developed RGU-Net.
