RGU-Net is a lightweight U-Net based model developed for automated brain extraction. The model implements the Ghost and Residual modules to produce 2D segmentation at a lower computational cost. 

This model was developed as part of my undergraduate dissertation and iterative model versions can be found in ablation study folder. The rgunet.py script contains the source code for the developed RGU-Net.
